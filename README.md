# WFZooï¼š A Toolbox for SOTA Website Fingerprinting Attacks and Defenses
Since my previous toolbox is not well organized and out-of-date (written in keras and py37), I decide to rewrite it. This toolbox is still under development. I will add more attacks and defenses in the future.
The code is tested fine with both py38 and py3.11. The conda enviroment I provided is based on py3.8 with pytorch 2.0 and cuda 11.

## TODO List
- About attacks
    - [x] DF attack
    - [ ] Tik-Tok attack
    - [ ] Add more attacks
- About defenses
    - [ ] FRONT
